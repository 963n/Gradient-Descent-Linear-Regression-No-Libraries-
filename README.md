# 📈 Linear Regression From Scratch (Height vs Weight)

A **from-scratch Machine Learning notebook** that implements **Linear Regression using Gradient Descent** (no sklearn model training).  
Given a person’s **weight (kg)**, the notebook learns a line **y = mx + b** to predict **height (cm)** — and visualizes both the **regression fit** and the **loss curve** during training. ✅

## 🧠 How It Works

### 1) Dataset
The notebook reads a CSV file containing two columns:
- **Input feature:** `Weight (kg)`
- **Target label:** `Height (cm)`

Expected file name/path in Colab:
- `/content/hight_weight.csv`

> If your file name is `height_weight.csv`, either rename it or update the path in the notebook.

---

### 2) Core Equation
We learn a straight line:

- **Model:** `y = m*x + b`  
  - `m` = slope  
  - `b` = intercept

A simple `predict(x, m, b)` function computes outputs.

---

### 3) Training (Gradient Descent)
Instead of using a ready-made ML library, the notebook computes:
- **MSE Loss**
- **Gradients (dm, db)**
- **Parameter updates** using a learning rate

Training runs for a large number of iterations until the loss stabilizes.

---

### 4) Output & Visualization
The notebook includes:
- ✅ A prediction example: **height at 72 kg**
- 📌 A scatter plot of the dataset + the learned regression line
- 📉 A loss curve showing **MSE vs iteration**

---

## ✨ Features

- Linear Regression implemented from scratch (no model APIs)
- Clean step-by-step functions:
  - `predict()`
  - `mse()`
  - `gradients()`
  - `gd_step()`
  - `gradient_descent()`
- Visualizes both **fit** and **training progress**
- Includes a real numeric prediction example (72 kg)

## ⚙️ Run Locally

### 1) Install Requirements

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib
```

(Optional) create a `requirements.txt`:

```txt
numpy
pandas
matplotlib
```

### 2) Add the Dataset

Place your CSV in the project folder:

* `hight_weight.csv`

Make sure it contains these columns exactly:

* `Weight (kg)`
* `Height (cm)`

### 3) Run the Notebook

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

Open:

* `Implementing_Linear_Regression_From_Scratch.ipynb`

## 🔍 Notes & Tips

* **Units matter:** weight must be in **kg**, height in **cm**.
* If training is slow, reduce `n_iters` or increase the learning rate carefully.
* If the loss is not decreasing, try:

  * smaller learning rate
  * feature scaling (normalize weight)

## 🚀 Future Improvements

* Add **train/test split** and report test MSE
* Compare with **closed-form solution** (Normal Equation)
* Add **feature scaling** for faster convergence
* Save learned parameters (`m`, `b`) to a file for reuse
* Turn it into a small **Streamlit app** (input weight → predicted height)
